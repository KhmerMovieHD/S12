I'm very sorry Sir but you have
the mayor's party

171
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,725
waiting for you in the

be right there.

go to the press
conference because..

180
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,579
a dozen traffic girls in the
back of that truck.

181
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:16,675
Gave us chase for two miles.

182
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,291

shit in the news?

written all over it.

- Not much longer.

191

you'll lose your pension and
you'll probably be prosecuted.

So do you want to hear this

193
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,811
or do you want to apply at
Walgreens across the street?

you ride off into the sunset.

Yes, Sir.

in Silverado, remember that?

Now the night they were killed
with those traffickers

we found the body of
that working girl.

Well he said he sent two other
hookers to that same party.

214
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,144
They weren't found
that night dead or alive.

215
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:26,680

216
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:27,801

217
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,304

the U.S. Attorney

221
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,047
that we can bring
those ladies in for questioning.

222
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,607
They were either
involved or may know who was.

223
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,751
And I took some convincing

224
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,095
but I got the marshals to agree

225
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,855
to send you down to
represent them

226
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,359
and represent us

227
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:49,367

back here from Mexico ASAP.
